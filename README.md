# I Love Apple
An app made for Apple fans

## Backstory
A little while ago, Linus from LinusTechTips joked about making an "I Love Apple" app where the only thing you can do is pay money to Apple via their 30% cut on in-app purchases.
While I couldn't add in-app purchases due to the fact that I don't want to pay £99.99 a year, I was still able to acheive the basics.

## Features
• Simple design
• Unique "I love Apple" audio clip (thanks to my brother for that)
• Popup with information on how to support Apple even more
• And a credits popup.

## Things I was going to add but realised it needs a "premium" Developer account
• In-app purchases
• Reminder every hour to "Love Apple" and press the Apple Logo
