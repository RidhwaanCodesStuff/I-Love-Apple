<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>I Love Apple is a concept app, inspired by the idea that was made on the WAN Show by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/LinusTechTips">Linus Tech Tips</a> <br> Their idea included an in-app purchase which would pay Apple via their 30% cut, but I didn't implement this feature, mainly due to the fact that in-app purchases need a Developer account.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<p>The app is <em>not</em> on the App Store mainly due to the £99/year charge for a developer account. To use the app on iOS, follow the tutorial below.</p>

<h3 id="macos-install">macOS Install</h3>
<p>macOS is not as strict when it comes to unsigned apps, so to install on macOS, you can simply copy the .app file from the <a href="https://github.com/Ridhwaan-and-Ahsan-Programming-Services/I-love-Apple/releases/tag/1.0.0">GitHub Repository</a> into your Applications folder.</p>

<h3 id="ios-install">iOS Install</h3>

<p>1) Download the source code on a Mac</p>

<p>2) Navigate to and open “I Love Apple.xcodeproj” in Xcode, then go to the Signing information and select an account to sign the App</p>

<p>3) Connect your iOS device to your Mac via USB <em>(this step can be skipped if your device is already set up to be able to connect to Xcode over the network)</em></p>

<p>4) Select your device in the top left then press Build (CMD+B)</p>

<p>5) Unplug your device and enjoy!</p>

<p>Notice: Due to strict rules on self-signed apps, if you do not have a premium Developer account, the app will unsign every 7 days. This tutorial assumes that you already have Xcode set up to sign apps with your Apple ID and you have some experience in Xcode.</p>
